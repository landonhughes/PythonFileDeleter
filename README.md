# PythonFileDeleter
This is a super simple project I made for my mom. She kept making duplicate files (by the hundreds) so I made a program that will delete those duplicate files for her.
## To Use
You must have Python 3.XX installed. 
Simply click the main.py file and it will walk you through the process. Just make sure to say "y" (yes) to checking sub directories otherwise this program won't work at all 
(this is just for extra confirmation).
Other notes:
For the file extension, just type the extension without the '.' (period). 
Example(s):
- a .mov file is mov 
- a .txt file is txt
